TRANSLATION
===========
Translations can be found in the ./inc/plugins/rememberus/lang/ folder. Copy the english/ directory
and rename the new folder to the name of the language. Make sure this is called the same as the 
language pack in MyBB is called. Translate all the .lang.php files in your lang directory.
If you like to share your translation, zip the folder of your translation, provide a small text file
that tells the user how to install it and upload the zip file to mods.mybb.com as a language pack for
this plugin. Thank you :)
